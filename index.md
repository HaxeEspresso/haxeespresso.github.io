## Welcome to Haxe Expresso

If you are here hopefully it means we have one thing in common: we are software developers and we use [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) to carry on some of out tasks. If this is the case you know for sure how broad Haxe is and may wonder what this blog is about: game development maybe? something "obscure" like the internals of the compiler? No, it is mainly about the boring JS target and the frontend world, but hopefully I will be able to also bring from time to time other variety of subjects.

I am in no sensible way a professional writer, nor I consider myself an expert in any subject, and if that's not enough, I am a busy person with barely free time,so it is quite possible I will be often inaccurate or plainly wrong. If that's case feel free to contact me, or even better, make a pull request fixing problems.

It is my wish that Haxe as a whole grows, it has an amazing community and the language has great potential, however it is not widely known, and having more content on the net created by multiple individuals could help change the situation. In the bizarre case one of the posts here gets to catch your attention, and you may happen to have a website, please, feel free to duplicate the post and/or link it back, not for recognition, but to increase the chances of people finding Haxe related topics when googling and to spread knowledge.

**Let's get this started!**
